# Project: Data Lake with Spark

## 1. Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

I am tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

I'll be able to test my database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare my results with their expected results.

## 2. Project Description

In this project, I'll build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3.

The steps are as follows:

- Load data from S3.
- Process the data into analytics tables using Spark.
- Load processed data back into S3.
- Deploy Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## 3. Project Datasets

I will be working on 2 datasets that reside on S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

- Song data: `s3a://udacity-dend/song_data`
- Log data: `s3a://udacity-dend/log_data`

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset:

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`

`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

This is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like:

`{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset:

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like:

### Output

Using our own S3 to store the data:
`s3a://<myS3Bucket>/sparkify/`

## 4. Project instructions

### a. Extract

- Store environment variables for AWS in a `dl.cfg` file.
- Read data from S3.

### b. Transform

- Testing the transform process on a small subset of data is an efficient way to ensure our program works without wasting processing time.
- Read the files with `spark.read.json` drop the duplicates and cache the results.
- Filter by `df.page == "NextSong"` for song plays.
- We follow the same steps for the users_table, songs_table and artists_table.

Table Schemas:

#### songs_table

#### artists_table

~~~~schema
root
 |-- artist_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_name: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_location: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_latitude: double (nullable = true)

 |-- week: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- month: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- year: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- weekday: integer (nullable = true)
~~~~

#### Song_plays

- Partition by `year` and `month`.

~~~~schema
root
 |-- start_time: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- userId: string (nullable = true)
 |-- level: string (nullable = true)
 |-- sessionId: long (nullable = true)
 |-- location: string (nullable = true)
 |-- userAgent: string (nullable = true)
 |-- song_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- artist_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- songplay_id: long (nullable = false)
~~~~

### c. Load

- Write tables to parquet files with:

`<table_name>.write.parquet("{}name/name_table.parquet".format(output_data))`

- Load tables into personal S3 bucket using `output_data` var.

#### d. Run

- We run the `etl.py` file with `$ python3 etl.py`.

## 4. Result

- We have our transformed data successfully loaded into a designated S3 bucket on AWS.
